#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with 11 tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 
#This is the final SQL project in my data analytics course.
#I came up with my own questions and answers using the concepts I have learned in the course.

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country='Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
# Show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country in the results.

SELECT customer.FirstName
, customer.LastName
, invoice.InvoiceId
, invoice.InvoiceDate
